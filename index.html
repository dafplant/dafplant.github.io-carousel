          <h2>I'm about...</h2>
         
          <h4>Music and Technology</h4>
          <p>I daydream about finding new ways of sourcing, creating and listening to music. I can’t be introduced to enough pioneering music or technology and I want to be a part of the movement.
            I’ve been instrumental in the founding of a start-up telecommunications company. I’ve worked there for 8 years. I build computers, navigate software and solve IT problems on a daily basis. I love being challenged by technology.
            Now it’s time to marry my passions and improve my skills so that I can operate on another level. I’ve found real enjoyment in coding. A deeper knowledge could unlock my potential to develop something new and contribute to a world of technological possibilities.  
            

          </p>
          
          <h5>Making</h5>
          <p>I  make music. I started drumming when I was 10, studied for a Music Diploma at Academy of Contemporary Music and now play with various bands, performing in cover acts and creating new sounds of various genres.
            I make other stuff, too! I made a dining room table this year, using reclaimed oak at a friend’s workshop. I’d like to make a drum kit next!</p>
         
          <h5>Travel</h5>
          <p>I travel. The destinations I choose are generally of geological interest. My favourite place to go is California where I am surrounded by pioneering tech startup company HQs, celebrity musicians, sunshine and incredible scenery and nature. I love hiking and have recently taken up rock climbing.</p>
          <h5>Environment</h5>
        <p>I care about our planet. One of the many things I love about technology is that it offers ways of developing sustainable solutions to the world’s problems. I have a keen interest in wildlife and a fascination for geology and astronomy. I aspire to work in an environment that is not detrimental to the global climate.

    <h3>Why Founders and Coders</h3>
    <p>Founders and Coders is an ideal platform for me to realise my lifelong ambition of becoming a Coder and Website Developer.  I am fascinated in technology. I recognise the need for world leading coding techniques in a fast growing industry and am excited to be a part of it’s growth. I want to fully focus on learning more skills so that I can contribute to the development of website functionality in new ways.
      Since engaging in Founders and Coders, I have been enthused by it’s teaching and learning ethos. I am looking forward to expanding my own knowledge and collaborating with other students to accelerate our learning.</p>
